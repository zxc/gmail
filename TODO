* Fix how searches are built.
    - Right now additional searches add to list of ids.
    - Should instead filter ids.
* Decide a good way to remove labels from a message
    - Looks to need a UID instead of message number
    - imaplib's support of UIDs is lacking
    - See imaplib.uid
* Figure out why LABEL search doesn't work
* Figure out why [Gmail]/Starred flag doesn't work
